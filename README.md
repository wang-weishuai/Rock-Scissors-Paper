# Rock-Scissors-Paper

### Sketch

This project uses [leap motion](https://developer.leapmotion.com/) to recognize our gesture(Rock / Scissors / Paper), and it was used as an interactive game once a time at the entrance of **No.5 courtyard of Jingyuan, Peking University**.

As we must provide API to leap motion, ./protos uses the open-source code of [tensorflow models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models).
